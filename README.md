# FlexLease

LeasePlan is one of the world's leading leasing companies, with 1.7 million cars in more than 30 countries. 
They manage the complete life cycle of cars, from the purchase and maintenance to the sale of returned lease cars.

This project was the first external project that the Rotterdam University of Applied Sciences had arranged for us. 
Leaseplan had contacted the university. Our task was to find a solution for the following question: Rethink urban mobility 
for LeasePlan using AI.

Troughout this project we used tools and methods like the Google design sprint, scrum, Strategyzers business model canvas 
and value proposition design. We made the application with React and the AI with BrainJS.

We have developed an application for freelancers who want a flexible lease subscription. 
Most freelancers, such as painters, have a car that they cannot use for every situation. Our application gives them the 
flexibility they deserve. The AI that we use can predict which car the user needs based on their agenda entries. 
It takes a number of things into account. Which car does the user currently have, how is the weather, what will the user 
do and does the user have company that travels with them. The AI makes a decision based on those questions and choose 
a perfect car for the situation. Initially, the AI will ask if the chosen car is okay, but later when the system has 
enough data, confirmation is no longer necessary.
